j## Dictionaries

- values, each with its own label (key:value pairs)
- the index is the key
```
purse = dict() or { }
purse['money'] = 12
purse['candy'] = 3
print(purse) # {'money':12, 'candy':3}
print(purse['candy']) # 3
```

## Counting with dictionaries
```
ccc = dict()
ccc['csev'] = 1
ccc['csev'] = ccc['csev'] + 1
```

- check for keys in dictionaries: 'csev' ==in== ccc (True)

```
counts = dict()
names = ['csev', 'cwen', 'csev', 'zqian', 'cwen']
for name in names:
	if name not in counts:
		counts[name] = 1
	else:
		counts[name] = counts[name] + 1
print(counts)
```

- the ==get== method for dictionaries

- if and else from the previous code lines can be replaced by get(), which checks if a key's already in the dictionary and assumes a default value if it's not
```
if name in counts:
	x = counts[name]
else:
	x = 0
	
-------------> x = counts.get(name, 0)
```

### Simplified counting with get()

- we can use get() and provide a default value of zero when the key is not yet in the dictionary, and then just add one

```
counts = dict()
names = ['csev', 'cwen', 'csev', 'zqian', 'cwen']
for name in names:
	counts[name] = counts.get(name, 0) + 1
print(counts)
```

## Dictionaries and Files

- counting pattern
```
counts = dict()
print('Enter a line of text: ')
line = input()

words = line.split()

print('Words:', words)

print('Counting...')
for word in words:
	counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1
print('Counts:', counts)
```

- definite loops and dictionaries
```
counts = {'chuck': 1, 'fred': 42, 'jan': 100}
for key in counts:
	print(key, counts[key])
```

- retrieving lists of keys and/or values: list(), keys(), values(), items()
```
print (list(counts)) # ['jan', 'chuck', 'fred']
print(counts.keys()) # ['jan', 'chuck', 'fred']
print(counts.values()) # [100, 1, 42]
print (counts.items()) # [('jan', 100), ('chuck', 1), ('fred', 42)]
```

- ==two iteration variables==
```
for key, value in counts.items():
	print (key, value) # jan 100...
```
