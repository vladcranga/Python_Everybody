## Lists

- a kind of collection which allows us to put many values in a single variable
	```
	friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
	print(['red', 24, 98.6])
	list = [1, [5,6], 7] # 3 elements in 'list'
	```
- a list can be in another list or empty
- for loops can be used: for i in list / for i in [...]/ for i in range(len(...))
- looking inside lists:
```
print(friends[1]) # starts from 0
```
- lists are mutable: elements can be changed
- len() displays the number of elements
- the range() function: returns a list of numbers from 0 to ==one less== than the parameter:
```
print(range(4)) # [0,1,2,3]
```

## Manipulating lists

- concatenate: use '+' (adds lists together)
- slice: like strings, the second number (list[1:3]) means ==up to but not including==
- dir(list): append, count, extend, insert, pop, index, remove, reverse, sort

- building a list from scratch:
```
stuff = list() # the list type, an empty list
stuff.append('book') # add to the end of the list
stuff.append(99) 
print(stuff) # ['book', 99]
```
- check if something is in a list: in/not in
```
>>> 99 in stuff
True
>>>99 not in stuff
False
```
- sort a list:
```
friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
friends.sort() 
print(friends) # ['Glenn', 'Joseph', 'Sally']
```

- built-in functions and lists: len(), max(), min(), sum()...

## Lists & Strings

- split() breaks a string into words and produces a list
```
abc = 'With three words'
stuff = abc.split() # ['With', 'three', 'words']
for w in stuff: ...
```
- split() can also look for other delimiters
```
line = 'first;second;third'
thing = line.split(';')
```
