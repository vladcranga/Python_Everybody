## Unicode Characters

- computers don't understand letters, they understand numbers, so there needed to be a way to map letters to numbers
-  ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interexchange
-  unicode: universal code that supports many languages

### Representing Simple Strings

- each character is represented by a number between 0 and 256 stored in 8 bits of memory (8 bits = 1 byte)
- the ==ord()== function tells us the numeric value of a simple ASCII character
```
>>> print(ord('H'))
72
>>> print(ord('\n'))
10
```

### Multi-byte Characters

- to represent the wide range of characters computers must handle, we represent characters with more than one byte:
	- UTF-16: fixed length, two bytes
	- UTF-32: fixed length, four bytes
	- ==UTF-8==: 1-4 bytes (compatible with ASCII, automatic detection between ASCII and UTF-8, recommended for encoding data to be exchanged between systems)

### Python Strings to Bytes

- when we talk to an external resource like a network socket, we send bytes and need to ==encode== python 3 strings into a given character encoding 
- when we read data from an external resource, we must ==decode== it based on the character set so that it is properly represented in python 3 as a string
```
while True:
	data = mysock.recv(512)
	if (len(data)<1):
		break
	mystring = data.decode() # assumes UTF-8 or ASCII 
	print(mystring)
```
