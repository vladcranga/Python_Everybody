## Files

- a text file is a sequence of lines

- opening a file:
	- tell python which file to open and what will be done with it
	- use the ==open()== function, which returns a 'file handle', a variable used to perform operations on the file
	- ``` handle = open(filename, mode)``` mode is 'r' for reading and 'w' for writing
	
- the newline character:
	- indicates when a line ends
	- represented as '\n' and is ==one character==
	
	## Processing files
	
	- a file handle open for read can be treated as a sequence of strings where each line is a string in the sequence
	- 'for' can iterate through a sequence (an ordered set)
		- ```
		xfile = open('mbox.txt')
		for cheese in file:
			print(cheese)
	- counting lines in a file:
		- ```
		fhand = open('mbox.txt')
		count = 0
		for line in fhand:
			count = count + 1
		print('Line count:', count)
	
	- reading the whole file:
		- ```
		fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
		inp = fhand.read()
		print (len(inp)) # 94626
		print (inp[:20]) # From stephen.marquar```
		
	- searching through a file: if in for loop (if startswith or if not startswith and continue), use line.rstrip() to get rid of the whitespace

	- using 'in' to select lines:
		- ```
		fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
		for line in fhand:
			line = line.rstrip()
			if not '@uct.ac.za' in line:
				continue
			print(line)```
	- prompt for file name: use input() and try/except+quit()
