## Reconstructing Data with JSON

#### Relational Power

- by removing the replicated data and replacing it with ==references to a single copy of each bit of data==, we build a 'web' of information that the relational database can read very quickly, even for large amounts of data
- often when you want some data, it comes from a number of tables linked by these foreign keys

#### The JOIN Operation

- ==links== across several tables as part of a select operation
- you must tell it ==how to use the keys== that make the connection between the tables using an ==ON clause== (like a 'where')

```
select Table1.field1, Table2.field2 from Table1 join Table2 on Table1.field3 = Table2.field4 
```

- The result of this is 'what we want to see', what comes after 'select' and before 'from'

```
select Album.title, Album.artist_id, Artist.id, Artist.name from Album join Artist on Album.artist_id = Artist.id
```

- The result of this is the table with 4 columns

- The track's title and the genre's name:

```
select Track.title, Genre.name from Track join Genre on Track.genre_id = Genre.id
```

- Not using an 'on' clause would mean 'all possible combinations of rows' (in this case each track appears twice and has two different genres, 8 rows in total)

- Things can get complex:

```
select Track.title, Artist.name, Album.title, Genre.name from Track join Artist join Album join Genre on Album.artist_id = Artist.id and Track.album_id = Album.id and Track.genre_id = Genre.id

(look at the foreign keys to know what to write after 'on')
```
