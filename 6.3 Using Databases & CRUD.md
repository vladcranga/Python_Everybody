## Using Databases

- there are two roles in a large project:
	- application developer: builds the logic, look and feel and monitors it for problems
	- database administrator(dba): monitors and adjusts the database as the program runs in production
- often both participate in the building of the 'data model'

### Database Model

- a database model/schema is the ==structure/format of a database==, described in a formal language supported by the database management system; the application of a data model when used in conjunction with a database management system

- common database systems: oracle (large, commercial, tweakable), mysql (simple but fast and scalable), sqlserver, sqlite, postgress, mongodb

## Single Table CRUD

- SQLite browser allows us to directly manipulate SQL files;
- SQLite is free, fast, small and embedded in Python 

1. Create a simple table

```
CREATE TABLE Users(
  name VARCHAR(128),
  email VARCHAR(128)
 )
```

2. SQL Insert

- inserts a row into a table

```
INSERT INTO Users(name, email) VALUES('Kristin', kf@umich.edu)
```

3. SQL Delete

- deletes a row in a table based on a selection criterion

```
DELETE FROM Users where email='fred@umich.edu'
```

4. SQL Update

- allows the updating of a field with a where clause

```
UPDATE Users SET name='Charles' WHERE email='csev@umich.com'
```

5. SQL Select

- retrieves a group of records (all or a subset by using a where clause)

```
SELECT * FROM Users

SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email='csev@umich.edu'
```

- sorting with order by (ascending or descending order)

```
SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY email

SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY name
```
