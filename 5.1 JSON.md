## JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

- JSON is more popular than XML and more straightforward
- JSON represents data as nested "dictionaries" and "lists"
```
import json # import the json library

data = '''
{
  "name" : "Chuck",
  "phone" : {
    "type" : "intl",
    "number" : "+1 734 303 4456"
   },
   "email" : {
     "hide" : "yes"
   }
}'''

info = json.loads(data) # deserialise to a Python object; "load from string", we get back a Python dictionary

print('Name:', info["name"])
print('Hide:', info["email"]["hide"]) # extract nested information
```
- JSON data as a list:
```
import json

data = '''
[
  { "id" : "001",
    "x" : "2",
    "name" : "Chuck"
  } ,
  { "id" : "009",
    "x" : "7",
    "name" : "Brent"
  }
]'''

info = json.loads(data) # info is a list here
print('User count:', len(info)) # so len() can be used

for item in info: # for used to go through the list
    print('Name', item['name']) # the list's items are dictionaries
    print('Id', item['id'])
    print('Attribute', item['x'])
```

## Service Oriented Approach

- most non-trivial web applications use services from other applications (e.g. credit card charge, hotel reservation systems)
- the services publish the "rules" applications must follow to make use of the service (==API==)

- multiple systems: initially two systems cooperate and split the problem, then multiple applications want to use the information/application as the data/service becomes useful
