## Regular Expressions

- regex/regexp: means for matching strings of text, written in a formal language
- very powerful but cryptic, a language unto themselves of "marker characters"

![[regex.png]]

- in order to use regular expressions, first import the relevant library:
```
import re
```

- use ==re.search()== to see if a string matches a regular expression (similar to the string find() method)
- use ==re.findall()== to extract portions of a string that match a regular expression (similar to find() and slicing)

### Using re.search() like find()

```
# find()
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.find('From:') >= 0:
        print(line)

# re.search()
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('From:', line):
        print(line)
```

### Using re.search() like startswith()

```
# startswith()
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        print(line)

# re.search()
import re
hand = open ('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^From:', line): # True if 'From:' is at the beginning of the line
        print(line)
```

### Wild-Card Characters

- the ==dot== character matches any character
- if you add the ==asterisk== character, the character is 'any number of times' (0 or more)
```
^X.*:  -> X followed by any number of characters, followed by a column
X-Sieve:
X-DSPAM:
X-Content-Type-Message-Body:
```
- fine-tuning your match: ==^X-\S+:==, where \S means 'match any non-whitespace character and + means 'one or more times'
```
X-Plane is behind the schedule: two weeks -> False
```

## Extracting Data

### Matching and Extracting Data

- re.search() returns a True/False depending on whether the string matches the regular expression
-  if we actually want the matching string to be extracted, we use ==re.findall()==
- [0-9]+ means ==one or more digits== ('or more' comes from the +, * would mean '0 or more')
```
import re
x = 'My 2 favorite numbers are 19 and 42'
y = re.findall('[0-9]+', x)
print(y) # ['2', '19', '42']
```
- re.findall() returns a ==list of zero or more sub-strings== that match the regular expression
```
import re
x = 'My favorite numbers are 19 and 42'
y = re.findall('[AEIOU]+', x) # one or more uppercase vowels
print(y) # []
```

### Greedy Matching

- The repeat characters (* and +) ==push outward in both directions== (greedy) to match the largest possible string
```
import re
x = 'From: Using the : character'
y = re.findall('^F.+:', x)
print(y) # ['From: Using the :']
``` 

### Non-Greedy Matching

- adding the ==? character== makes the matching less greedy
```
import re
x = 'From: Using the : character'
y = re.findall('^F.+?:', x)
print(y) # ['From:']
```

### Fine-tuning String Extraction

- you can separately determine which portion of the match will be extracted by using parantheses
```
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5

y = re.findall('\S+@\S+', x)
print(y) # stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
```
- \S+  means 'at least one non-whitespace character'

- parantheses are not part of the match, but they tell where to ==start== and ==stop== what string to extract
```
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5

y = re.findall('^From (\S+@\S+)', x)
print(y) # stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
```

### Extracting a host name: find() vs double split() vs findall()
- find():
```
data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5'
atpos = data.find('@')
print(atpos) # 21
sppos = data.find(' ', atpos)
print(sppos) # 31
host = data[atpos+1 : sppos]
print(host) # uct.ac.za
```

- double split()
```
line = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5'
words = line.split()
email = words[1]
pieces = email.split('@')
print(pieces[1]) # uct.ac.za
```

- findall() #1
```
import re
line = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5'
y = re.findall('@([^ ]*)', line)
print(y) # ['uct.ac.za']
```
- the @ start means 'look through the string until you find @' ; [^ ] means 'match a non-blank character' (everything but a space), where [ ] means 'character' and ^ means 'not' ; * means "0 or more times"

- findall() #2 (cooler version)
```
import re
line = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5'
y = re.findall('^From .*@([^ ]*)', line)
print(y) # ['uct.ac.za']
```
- '^From' means "look for ^From at the beginning of the line" ; a space after "From" means there will also be one when matching ; .*@ means "any number of characters up to an @" ; ([^ ]*) means "extract all the non-blank characters"

### Spam Confidence

```
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
numlist = list()
for line in hand:
	line = line.rstrip()
	stuff = re.findall('^X-DSPAM-CONFIDENCE: ([0-9.]+)', line)
	if len(stuff) != 1: continue # skip the line if there are more numbers than 1
	num = float(stuff[0])
	numlist.append[num]
print ('Maximum:', max(numlist)) # Maximum: 0.9907
```
- [0-9.]+ is what extracts floating point numbers

### Escape Character \

- used to make a regex character behave normally (e.g. $)
```
import re
x = 'We just received $10.00 for cookies.'
y = re.findall('\$[0-9.]+', x)
print(y) # ['$10.00']
