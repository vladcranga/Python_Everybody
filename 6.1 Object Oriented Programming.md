## Object Oriented Definitions and Terminology

- a program is made up of many cooperating objects
- instead of being the whole program, each object is a small part that cooperates with other objects
- an object is like self-contained code and data; they break a problem into smaller problems and have boundaries

#### Definitions
- class: a template (we can use dir() to find the capabilities of our newly created class)
- method or message: a defined capability of a class
- field or attribute: a bit of data in a class
- object or instance: a particular instance of a class

## Object Life Cycle

- objects are created, used and discarded
- there are special methods that get called:
	- at the moment of creation (==constructor==); used a lot
	- at the moment of destruction (destructor); rarely used

#### Constructors

- set up some instance variables to have the proper initial values when the object is created
- can have additional parameters used to set up instance variables for the particular instance of the class (for the particular object)

#### Many Instances

- we can create lots of objects; the class is the template for the object
- we can store each distinct object in its own variable (have multiple instances of the same class)
- each instance has its own copy of the ==instance variables==

## Object Inheritance

- when we make a new class, we can reuse an existing class and ==inherit== all the capabilities of an existing class and then add more
- a form of store and reuse (write once, reuse many times)
- the new parent (child) has all the capabilities of the old class (parent) and more
- ==subclasses== are more specialised versions of a class, which inherit attributes and behaviours from their parent classes and can introduce their own
