## Networked Technology

### Transport Control Protocol

- built on top of IP, assumes IP might lose some data, handles flow control using a transmit window, provides a reliable ==pipe==

- an internet/network socket is an endpoint of a bidirectional inter-process communication flow across an IP-based computer network, such as the Internet

- a port is an application-specific or process-specific software communication endpoint; it allows multiple networked applications to coexist on the same server 

### Sockets in Python

- python has built-in support for TCP sockets
```
import socket
mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect( ('data.pr4e.org', 80) )
```

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

- the dominant application layer protocol on the internet, invented for the web to retrieve html, images, documents...; extended to be data in addition to documents: rss, web services...
-  basic concepts: make a connection, request a document, retrieve a document, close the connection
- when the user visits a page, the browser makes a connection to the web server and issues a "GET" request, then the server returns the HTML document to the browser which formats and displays the document to the user

### HTTP requests in Python
```
import socket

mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))
cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n'.encode()
mysock.send(cmd)

while True:
	data = mysock.recv(512)
	if (len(data) < 1):
		break
	print(data.decode())

mysock.close()
```
