## Data on the Web

- once HTTP was well understood and supported, there was a move towards exchanging data between programs, and there needed to be a way to represent it 
- there are two commonly used formats: XML (older and more complex) and JSON (newer and more lightweight)

## XML
- eXtensible Markup Language, used to share structured data

- uses tags and attributes, spaces and indentation don't matter to the language but they make the code more readable

- tags indicate the beginning and ending of elements
- attributes are keyword/value pairs on the opening tag
- serialise/deserialise: convert data in a program into a common format that can be stored and/or transmitted between systems in a programming language-independent manner	

## XML Schema
- XML schema: description of a "contract", legal format as to what is acceptable XML; expressed in terms of constraints on the structure and content of documents
- often used to specify a "contract" between systems (e.g. a system will only accept xml that conforms to a schema); if a particular piece of xml meets the specification of the schema, it is said to "validate"

- there are many schema languages, the one we will focus on is XSD XML Schema (W3C Spec)
