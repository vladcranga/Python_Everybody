## Sets

- The items in a set must be unique.
- Sets are defined using curly brackets.
```
x = {1, 2, 3, 4}
```
- If we store duplicate values,  they will only be printed once.

- Sets support the usual set operations like intersection, union and difference.
```
print({1,2,3,7,8, 9}.intersection({1,3,6,7,10}))
print({1,2,3,7,8, 9}.union({1,3,6,7,10}))
print({1,2,3,7,8, 9}.difference({1,3,6,7,10}))
```
