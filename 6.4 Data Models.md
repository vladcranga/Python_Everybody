## Designing a Data Model

- Database design is an art form of its own with particular skills and experience
- The goal is to design clean and easily understood databases

#### Building a Data Model

- Drawing a picture of the data objects for our application and then figuring out how to represent the objects and their relationships
- Basic rule: don't put the ==same string data in twice==; use a ==relationship== instead
- When there is one thing in the "real world" there should be one copy of that thing in the database

- The first table will be the 'Track' table, as in this app the track is the central element; the attributes related to the track are rating, len, count
- This table ==belongs to== the table 'Album'; the table 'Artist' belongs to the table 'Album'
- genre belongs to Track because putting it in the other tables (album, artist) will change the genre of all the artist's/album's songs

## Representing a Data Model in Tables

- a primary key is a unique number, a way to refer to a particular row (the ending point of the arrow)
- the foreign key is a starting point of the arrow
- the logical key is a unique thing to loop up a row from the outside world

- In the DB Browser, the tables will be created from left to right: Artist, Album/Genre, Track

## Inserting Relational Data

```
insert into Artist (name) values ('Led Zeppelin')
insert into Artist (name) values ('AC/DC')
```

- The id field isn't specified because it's auto-generated, as chosen when the table was created.

```
insert into Genre (name) values ('Rock');
insert into Genre (name) values ('Metal')
```

- Adding a semicolon at the end of a statement allows us to run multiple statements at the same time in the DB Browser

```
insert into Album (title, artist_id) values ('Who Made Who', 2);
insert into Album (title, artist_id) values ('IV', 1)
```

```
insert into Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id)
	values ('Black Dog', 5, 297, 0, 2, 1) ;
insert into Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id)
	values ('Stairway', 5, 482, 0, 2, 1) ;
insert into Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id)
	values ('About to Rock', 5, 313, 0, 1, 2) ;
insert into Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id)
	values ('Who Made Who', 5, 207, 0, 1, 2)
```
