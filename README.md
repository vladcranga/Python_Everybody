# Python for Everybody

This is a repository that contains my notes and assignments from ["Python for Everybody"](https://py4e/org).

It covers the following topics:
- Python Basics
- Python Data Structures
- Python Web Scraping

- An additional Python project

The notes have been taken using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), which allows you to enter code and pictures alongside your notes.
