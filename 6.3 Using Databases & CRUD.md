## Using Databases

- there are two roles in a large project:
	- application developer: builds the logic, look and feel and monitors it for problems
	- database administrator(dba): monitors and adjusts the database as the program runs in production
- often both participate in the building of the 'data model'

### Database Model

- a database model/schema is the ==structure/format of a database==, described in a formal language supported by the database management system; the application of a data model when used in conjunction with a database management system

- common database systems: oracle (large, commercial, tweakable), mysql (simple but fast and scalable), sqlserver, sqlite, postgress, mongodb

## Single Table CRUD

- SQLite browser allows us to directly manipulate SQL files;
- SQLite is free, fast, small and embedded in Python 

1. Create a simple table

```
CREATE TABLE Users(
  name VARCHAR(128),
  email VARCHAR(128)
 )
```

2. SQL Insert

- inserts a row into a table

```
INSERT INTO Users(name, email) VALUES('Kristin', kf@umich.edu)
```

3. SQL Delete

- deletes a row in a table based on a selection criterion

```
DELETE FROM Users where email='fred@umich.edu'
```

4. SQL Update

- allows the updating of a field with a where clause

```
UPDATE Users SET name='Charles' WHERE email='csev@umich.com'
```

5. SQL Select

- retrieves a group of records (all or a subset by using a where clause)

```
SELECT * FROM Users

SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email='csev@umich.edu'
```

- sorting with order by (ascending or descending order)

```
SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY email

SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY name
```

#### Example: Counting Email in a Database

```
import sqlite3

# connect to the database; creates the file if it doesn't exist
conn = sqlite3.connect('emaildb.sqlite') 

# like a handle, send commands to the cursor
cur = conn.cursor()  

cur.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Counts')

cur.execute('''
CREATE TABLE Counts (email TEXT, count INTEGER)''')

fname = input('Enter file name: ')

fh = open(fname)
for line in fh:
    if not line.startswith('From: '): continue
    pieces = line.split()
    email = pieces[1]
	
	# ? acts as a placeholder, used to deal with sql injections
	# use a tuple to mark what will to in the place of ?
    cur.execute('SELECT count FROM Counts WHERE email = ? ', (email,))
	
    row = cur.fetchone()
    if row is None:
        cur.execute('''INSERT INTO Counts (email, count)
                VALUES (?, 1)''', (email,))
    else:
        cur.execute('UPDATE Counts SET count = count + 1 WHERE email = ?',
                    (email,))
	# write to disk
    conn.commit()

# https://www.sqlite.org/lang_select.html
sqlstr = 'SELECT email, count FROM Counts ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10'

for row in cur.execute(sqlstr):
    print(str(row[0]), row[1])

cur.close()
```

- Because the sample code is using an **UPDATE** statement and committing the results to the database as each record is read in the loop, it might take as long as a few minutes to process all the data. The commit insists on completely ==writing all the data to disk every time it is called.==

- The program can be speeded up greatly by moving the commit operation outside of the loop. In any database program, there is a balance between the ==number of operations you execute between commits== and the importance of ==not losing the results of operations== that have not yet been committed.
