# Python for Everybody

This is a repository that contains my notes and assignments from ["Python for Everybody"](https://py4e/org) and from an [edX](https://edx.org) course.

It covers the following topics:
- [X] Python Basics
- [X] Python Data Structures
- [X] Python Web Scraping
- [ ] Python Databases
- [ ] An additional Python project

The notes have been taken using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), which allows you to enter code and pictures alongside your notes.
