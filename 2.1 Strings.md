## Strings

- a string is a sequence of characters
- '+' means concatenate
- int() converts numbers in a string to integers
- input() gives back a ==string==

- looking inside strings:
```python3
fruit = 'banana'
letter = fruit[1] #starts from 0, can also be computed
print(letter) # a
```

- the len() function returns the length of a string:
```python3
fruit = 'banana'
print(len(fruit)) # 6
```

- loop through strings:
```python3
fruit = 'banana'
index = 0
while index < len(fruit): # 0 to 5
	letter = fruit[index]
	print(index, letter) # 0 b 1 a...
	index = index + 1

# !more elegant way with for:
fruit = banana
for letter in fruit/'banana':
	print(letter)
```

- slicing strings: use a colon (:) operator, the second number means '==up to but not including=='
```python3
s = "Monty Python"
print (s[0:4]) # Mont
print (s[6:7]) # P
print (s[6:20]) # Python
```

- 'in' as a logical operator:
```
fruit = 'banana'
'n' in fruit # True
if 'a' in fruit:
	...
```

- string comparison
	- == for equal, < for less than (comes before), > for more than (comes after)
	- A < a

- string functions
	- .lower() 
	```
	greet = 'Hello Bob'
	zap = greet.lower()
	print (zap) # hello bob
	```
	-.find()
	```
	fruit = 'banana'
	pos = fruit.find('na') # 2, -1 if nothing is found
	```
	-.replace()
	```
	greet = 'Hello Bob'
	nstr = greet.replace('Bob', 'Jane') # Hello Jane
	```
	- .strip() removes white spaces (.lstrip(), .rstrip() also exist)
	- .startswith()
		```
		line = 'Please have a nice day'
		line.startswith('Please') # True
		line.startswith('P') # False
		```
	- more methods: **dir()**

-in python 3, ==all strings are unicode==
