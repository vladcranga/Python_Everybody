Jupyter notebooks run cells individually. Any cell in the notebook can access a variable
assigned from a cell that has been run in the current notebook session.

1- 1.1 -> Print and comments 
-Print in Python works like this: print("Hello World")
-Comments in Python work like this: # at every code line -> # this is hello world for python 3
-We can use basic operations and print a variable like this: 
x = 2
y = x + 5
y (this outputs 7)

1- 1.2 -> Types and variables
\*What is a string?
- A string is a sequence of characters, keyboard characters for the most part.
- Use matching single or double quotes to print: print('string') and print ("string")

\*Integers
- Integers are numbers, positive and negative, 0 included
- Compared to strings, which contain digits too, integers are not just a picture/representation of those numbers
- Compare '123a' or '123' to 123 and print('123a') or print('123') to print(123)

\*Variables and storing string in variables
- A variable is a container, it holds an object.
- Use descriptive variable names, lower case, sometimes words connected with underscores
- You can assign strings to variables too, not just numbers
- We can assign a value, run a cell (student\_name = "Joana Dias"), and then echo the variable ( student\_name or print(student\_name) )
- We can also reassign values to variables and they will show different values this way.

\*Data types in variables
- Python allows you to change the data type of your variables
- You can assign a string to a variable and change it to an integer only to later change it to a string again.

1- 1.3 -> Type function

\*Using the Python type() function
- str: string, int: integer, float: floating point decimal
- examples: type(3.14) shows float, type(5) shows int, type("Collete") shows str
- !We can also print the type function: print(type(5)) shows <class 'int'>
- We can also use this function for variables : type(student) or print(type(student))

1- 1.4 -> Addition & Errors

\*Addition: Number & String
- Add numbers by using the + sign: print (12.3 + 4.1)
- Concatenate string by using the + sign: "my name is " + "Allysa" or print("Hello, " + "my name is " + "Allysa"
- !Only add strings to strings and numbers to numbers when using variables: 
 
	shoe\_color = "brown" 
	"my shoe color is " + shoe\_color
                                                                            
\*Variable Addition
- We can assign a sum to a variable and print it: add\_two = 34 + 16 then print(add\_two)
- We can use the string concatenation and assign strings to a variable: first\_name = Anton
                                                                        greeting = "Happy Birthday " + first\_name
                                                                        print(greeting)
- We can further build on that variable: greeting\_today = greeting + ", today is the day!"
- We can add integer variables too: add\_two = 16+34
                                    add\_four = add\_two + add\_two
                                    
 \*Errors & More Errors!
 - Type errors -> Types of different types are not allowed to be combined (e.g. Can't add an integer to a string)
 - Syntax errors -> Not following the rules of Python (e.g. Strings not having mathing quotes or a variable name starting with a number)
 - Name errors ->  Python cannot find a name in the program (e.g. Capitalised Print or not defining something)
 
 1 - 1.5 -> Character Art/ASCII Art
 
 \*Concept: Character Art
 - Basicly it adds creativity or rewards users for giving the correct answer
 - Just use many print() functions and play with spaces and quotes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 1 - 2.1 -> Input
 
 \*User input
 - To request user imput, we use the input() statement: small\_int = input() (you can add print() before that line to let the user know)
 - We can then print the variable which has been assigned a value and we can also change its value over and over again.
 -! No matter what we enter, be it string, integer, or floating point decimals, type() of an input() variable will always return str.
 -! We cannot add, for example, a 3 from input() to another 3 because one of them is a string.
 
 \*Input prompts/User prompts using input
 - The input function has an optional string argument which displays a string intended to inform users what to enter.
 - input() works similar to print() in the way it displays arguments as output.
 - Example: student\_name = input("Enter the student name: ") 
            print("Hi, " + student\_name)
            
1 - 2.2 -> print() formatting

\*Comma separated string printing
- Python provides several methods of formatting strings in the print() function beyond string addition.
- By using commas to separate strings, print() will output each string separated with a space by default.
- Example: name = "Collete"
           print("Hello to",name,"who is from our city")

\*Printing numbers with string using comma
- By using this comma format, there will be no type error: NO -> print("I will pick you up @" + 6 + "for the party")
                                                           YES-> print("I will pick you up @",6,"for the party")
                                                        or YES-> print("I will pick you up @" + "6" + "for the party")
- We can even print strings, numbers, and variables in the same statement:
                                                    num\_error = 0
                                                    print("Int = ",14,"with strings causes",num\_error,"errors in comma format")
                                                    
                                                    
1 - 2.3 -> Quote display and Boolean

\* Representing quotes inside of quoted strings
- To use single quotes, use double quotes for the outer string: print("It's time to save your code.")
- To use double quotes, use single quotes for the outer string: print('The teacher said: "class, restart the kernel!"')

\*Boolean string tests
- Boolean string methods return true or false. We use them like this: "string".isalpha()...
- .isalpha() returns true if the string consists of alphabetical characters: "Python".isalpha() is true but "Python ".isalpha() is not.
! Spaces and punctuation will return false.
- .isalnum() returns true if the string consists of digits and alphabetical characters: "3rd".isalnum() is true
                                                                                        "3rd ".isalnum() is false
- .startswith() checks what character a string starts with and is CASE SENSITIVE: "Save".startswith("s") is false  
                                                                                  "Save".startswith("S") is true                                                                               
- .islower() checks for lowercase characters: "HEY".islower() is false
- .isupper() checks for uppercase characters: "HEY".isupper() is true
- .istitle() checks if every word separated by a space in the string is uppercase: "The End".istitle() is true
- .isdigit() checks if a string consists of digits: cm\_height = "146"
                                                    cm\_height.isdigit()
- We can use these string tests inside a comma formatted print statement: print(cm\_height,"is all digits:",cm\_height.isdigit())
 
1 - 2.4 -> String Formatting & "in" keyword

\*String format methods
- The string format methods allow us to alter strings.
- .lower() changes the letters to lowercase letters
- .upper() changes the letters to uppercase letters
- .capitalize() will capitalise the first word/sentence with the first letter of it (!uppercase letters will be changed to lowercase)
- .title() will capitalise the words in a sentence
- .swapcase() will swap uppercase letters with lowercase letters and vice versa

\*Input formatting
- We can use the string format methods to change user input.
- To invoke methods, add (e.g.: .lower) to input(): fav\_color = input("What is your favourite color?").lower()
                                                    print(fav\_color)
\*Boolean "in" keyword
- Search for strings inside strings.
- !Strings are case sensitive when compared using the \*in\* keyword. -> menu = "salad, pasta, sandwich, pizza, drinks, dessert"
                                                                       print('Pizza' in menu) returns False
- !We can use .lower() when case sensivity is not important: menu = "salad, pasta, sandwich, pizza, drinks, dessert"
                                                             print('Pizza'.lower() in menu.lower()) returns True
!Restaurant program to check for specific products in the menu and add products: 
menu = "salad, pasta, sandwich, pizza, water, beer, wine, chips, rice, sushi, fish, vegan, vegetarian"
print("Hello, the current menu is:", menu)
add\_item = input("Please add a new product to our menu:")
menu = menu + ', ' + add\_item
print("Product named", '"' + add\_item + '"', "is now part of our menu. Thank you!")
menu\_ask = input("What are you looking for? ")
print("Product named",'"'+menu\_ask+'"',"exists in the menu?",menu\_ask.lower() in menu)

!Program checking for allergy
 Allergy check 
 1\[ \] get input for test
input\_test = input("Enter some things eaten in last 24 hrs: ")
 2/3\[ \] print True if "dairy" is in the input or False if not
print("It is", "dairy" in input\_test.lower(), "that", '"' + input\_test + '"', 'contains "dairy"')
 4\[ \] Check if "nuts" are in the input
print("It is", "nuts" in input\_test.lower(), "that", '"' + input\_test + '"', 'contains "nuts"')
 4+\[ \] Challenge: Check if "seafood" is in the input
print("It is", "seafood" in input\_test.lower(), "that", '"' + input\_test + '"', 'contains "seafood"')
 4+\[ \] Challenge: Check if "chocolate" is in the input

print("It is", "chocolate" in input\_test.lower(), "that", '"' + input\_test + '"', 'contains "chocolate"')

2 - 3.1 -> Simple Functions

\*Calling functions with arguments
- The print() statement can take 0 to many arguments. print("Hello", "World!") -> 2 arguments
                                                    print() -> 0 arguments !is like an enter or <<endl in c++
                                                    print("Hi") -> 1 argument
- The type() function takes one argument and returns a value, unlike print() that sends text to standards output, such as the console.

\*Create a simple function
- A simple function can be created with the "def" keyword, function name, followed by parenthesis and a colon(:). 
- An example of a user created function is: def say\_hi():
                                                print("Hello world!") !!!Use 4 spaces to put lines in such functions.
                                            say\_hi() calling the function outside of it, as the indentation has ended    
- We can end the functions by ending the indentations.

\*Calling a function by name
- Call a simple function using the function name followed by parentheses. For instance, calling print is
print().

\*Function parameters (pəˈræmɪtə(r))
- Function parameters allow data to be passed to and used by functions.
- Example with explanations: # yell\_this() yells the string Argument provided
                               def yell\_this(phrase): # this function has the name of a variable in the parenthesis
                                   print(phrase.upper() + "!") # the variable is used inside the function code, in this case in print()
    
                              call function with an argument, which is a string in this case
                             yell\_this("It is time to save the notebook")
- We can also call a function without arguments by setting a default value: def say\_this(phrase = "Hi"):  
                                                                            print(phrase)
                                                                            say\_this()
                                                                            say\_this("Hello") # will still work, it ignores the default

2 -3.2 -> Function return & multi-parameters

\*Call function with return
- Functions can return using the "return" keyword within the body of the function. Return sends back a value to the calling function.
- Example: def msg\_double(phrase):
               double = phrase + " " + phrase
               return double # returns the variable !Return is followed by an object, which can be a literal string, variable, number...
           msg\_2x = msg\_double("let's go") # the parameter "phrase" gets replaced with the value "let's go" in quotations
                                           # this function's call is replaced by the return value
           print(msg\_2x) # outputs "let's go let's go"
- Example #2: def half\_value(value):
                  return value/2
              print(half\_value(42)) # outputs 21
- Task #1: # create and call make\_doctor() with full\_name argument from user input - then print the return value
            def make\_doctor(full\_name):
                full\_name = "Doctor " + full\_name
                return full\_name
            full\_name = input("Enter your full name:")
            print (make\_doctor(full\_name))

\*Functions with multiple parameters
- Sometimes we might need to make functions with multiple parameters. In order to do that, we need multiple arguments.
- We separate the arguments when we call and the parameters when we define with COMMAS.
- Example #1 
            def make\_schedule(period1, period2):
                schedule = ("\[1st\] " + period1.title() + ", \[2nd\] " + period2.title())
                return schedule
            student\_schedule = make\_schedule("mathematics", "history")
            print("SCHEDULE:", student\_schedule)
- Example #2
         def format\_info(name, age, school):
             return "Student: " + name + "\\nAge: " + str(age) + "\\nSchool: " + school # this return is made up of a string concatenation
          !!! the \\n format characters makes a new line/ is like <<endl in c++
          !!! str(age) turns the integer into a string so it can be added with +
              
2 - 3.2 -> Sequence

\*Considering sequence
- In programming, sequence refers to the order that code is processed.
- Objects in Python, such as variables and functions, are not available until they have been processed.
- Processing sequence flows from the top of a page of code to the bottom.
- This often means that Function definitions are placed at the beginning of a page of code.
-! Program that checks for a hat color, with the function defined at the top, not at the bottom! 
            def hat\_available(color):
                hat\_colors = 'black, red, blue, green, white, grey, brown, pink'
                return color.lower() in hat\_colors
            have\_hat = hat\_available('green')  
            print('hat available is', have\_hat)
\*Avoid hard coded values
- Hard-coding" is placing data values directly into code (have\_hat = hat\_available('green') where the argument 'green' is hard-coded).
- Use variables and verse hard-coded (example: color = "green").
- Often preferable to use input such as a configuration file (advanced topic) or user input, making the code more reusable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 - 4.1 -> Conditionals: Boolean Strings

\*if, else, pass
- Conditionals use True or False.
- A first example would be: if True:        # in this case it's always true unless I write something else, such as "not True"
                               print("True")
                            else:
                                  print("False")
- We can actually use the "not True" statement: if not True:         # this will print "False", we can also use "if False:"
                                                   print("True")
                                                else:
                                                      print("False")
- We can set a variable to True or False: someone\_i\_know = True
                                          if someone\_i\_know:
                                             print("How are you?")
                                          else:
                                               print("Nice to meet you!")
- If we do not want to do anything, we can use the word "pass": someone\_i\_know = True
                                                                if someone\_i\_know:
                                                                   print("How are you?")
                                                                else: 
                                                                      pass
\*Boolean string methods
- Boolean string methods, such as .isalpha() and .isnum() can be used to control the flow of code in an if statement.
- An example that checks for book titles: favorite\_book = input("Enter the title of a favorite book: ")
                                                          if favorite\_book.istitle():
                                                          print(favorite\_book, "- nice capitalization in that title!")
                                                          else:
                                                            print(favorite\_book, "- consider capitalization throughout for book titles.")
- We can also use multiple if statements combined with the pass statement: a\_number = input("enter a positive integer number: ")
                                                                           if a\_number.isdigit():
                                                                           print(a\_number, "is a positive integer")
                                                                           else:
                                                                                print(a\_number, "is not a positive integer")
    
                                                                            another if
                                                                           if a\_number.isalpha():
                                                                           print(a\_number, "is more like a word")
                                                                           else:
                                                                                 pass
- A program that checks whether or not strings start with 'w' using functions: 
                                    test\_string\_1 = "welcome"
                                    test\_string\_2 = "I have $3"
                                    test\_string\_3 = "With a function it's efficient to repeat code"
                                    # \[ \] create a function w\_start\_test() use if & else to test with startswith('w')
                                    def w\_start\_test(test\_string):
                                    if test\_string.startswith('w'):
                                       print("String " + "'" + test\_string + "'" + " starts with 'w'.")
                                    else: print("String " + "'" + test\_string + "'" + " does not start with 'w'.")
                                    # \[ \] Test the 3 string variables provided by calling w\_start\_test()
                                    w\_start\_test(test\_string\_1)
                                    w\_start\_test(test\_string\_2)
                                    w\_start\_test(test\_string\_3) 

3 - 4.2 -> Conditionals: Comparison Operators

\*Comparison Operators:
- Comparison Operators include: "<", ">", ">=", "<=", "=="(compare), "="(assign), "!="(not equal)
- Examples with numbers: 3<5 will output "True", 3>5 will output "False", 3>=3 will output "True"
- Assign vs Compare example: points = 0 (assignment)
                             points == 9 (comparison)
- Example with "not equal":  x = 3
                             print(x != 9)  # True
 
 \*If comparison
 - Comparison operators evaluate to Boolean True and False to direct the flow of if conditionals.
 - Example using an if else statement:          x = 23
                                                if x > 25:
                                                   print("X is already greater than 25.")
                                                else: 
                                                   print("X was", x)
                                                   x = 26
                                                   print("Now X is", x) 
                                                   
3 - 4.3 -> Conditionals: String Comparison

\*Concept: String Comparison
- Strings can be equal (==) or unequal (!=).
- Strings can be greater than (>) or less than (<). !Alphabetically, "A" is less than "B".
                                                    !Lower case "a" is greater than upper case "A".

\*String compare with if
- String comparisons will resolve to true and false and therefore we can use them in an if statement to control the flow of our code.
- Example #1: msg = "Save the notebook"
              if msg.lower() == "save the notebook":
                 print("message as expected")
              else:
                 print("message not as expected")
- Example #2: l\_name = input("enter last name: ")
              if l\_name.lower() <= "c": #.lower() and Lower case c because all upper case letters would be less than "c"
              print("Welcome to the a, b, c line.")
  
3 - 5.1 -> Conditions elif and casting

\*elif
-When there is a need to test for multiple conditions, there is elif.
-elif  statement follows  if, and means "else, if " another condition exists do something else
-elif  can be used many times
-else  is used after the last test condition (if or elif)
-Like else, the elif only executes when the previous if conditional is False.
-Example: weather = input("Enter weather (sunny, rainy, snowy): ") 
          if weather.lower() == "sunny":
             print("Wear a t-shirt")
          elif weather.lower() == "rainy":
             print("Bring an umbrella and boots")
          elif weather.lower() == "snowy":
             print("Wear a warm coat and hat")
          else:
             print("Sorry, not sure what to suggest for", weather)

\*Concept: Casting
-Casting is the conversion from one data type to another, such as converting from str to int.
-The int() function can convert stings that represent whole counting numbers into integers 
and strip decimals to convert float numbers to integers. !( float() and str() also exist)!
-int("1") = 1 the string representing the integer character "1", cast to a number
-int(5.1) = 5 the decimal (float), 5.1, truncated into a non-decimal (integer)
-int("5.1") = ValueError "5.1" isn't a string representation of integer, int() can cast only strings representing integer values
-Example #1: weight1 = '60' # a string
             weight2 = 170 # an integer
             # add 2 integers
             total\_weight = int(weight1) + weight2
             print(total\_weight)
-Example#2: age\_new\_student = input("Enter age: ")
            grad\_age = float(age\_new\_student) + 3.75
            print("age upon graduation will be", grad\_age)
            grad\_age\_msg = "age upon graduation will be", str(grad\_age)
            print(grad\_age\_msg)

\*Casting input:
-input() strings that represent numbers can be "cast" to integer values.
-Example #1: student\_age = input('enter student age (integer): ')
             age\_next\_year = int(student\_age) + 1
             print('Next year student will be',age\_next\_year)
-!Example #2: # cast to int at input
              student\_age = int(input('enter student age (integer): ')) #!cast to int at input here
              age\_in\_decade = student\_age + 10
              print('In a decade the student will be', age\_in\_decade)              
-!!Example #3: Adding calculator: .isdigit() is a string method
               number\_1 = input("Enter the first number: ")
               number\_2 = input("Enter the second number: ")
               if number\_1.isdigit() == True and number\_2.isdigit() == True:
               print(number\_1, '+', number\_2, '=', int(number\_1) + int(number\_2))
               else: print("Both numbers must be digits.")

3 - 5.2 -> Math Operators

\*Concept: Basic Math Operators
-Python contains all of the basic math operators.
+ addition
-(dash/minus) subtraction
\* multiplication
/ division !Will always result in a float.
-We can write the operations directly or by using print().
-Things inside round brackets are evaluated before things that are outside of them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4 - 6.1 -> Nested Conditionals

\*Concept: Nested Conditionals
-Nested conditionals allow subdecisions to be made by indenting conditional statements underneath other conditional statements.
-Example: if the first if runs, the further ifs will run too
if
    if
        if
        else
    else
else

\*Escape sequences
-escape sequences all start with a backslash (\\)
-escape sequences can be used to display characters in python reserved for formatting
\\\\   Backslash (\\) # print("for a newline use \\\\n")
\\'   Single quote (')
\\"   Double quote (") # print("\\"quotes in quotes\\"")
-escape sequences are part of special formatting characters
\\t   Tab # student\_age = 17 student\_name = "Hiroto Yamaguchi" print("STUDENT NAME\\t\\tAGE") print(student\_name,'\\t' + str(student\_age))
\\n   return or newline # print('Hello World!\\nI am formatting print ')
-We use escape sequences in strings - usually with print() statements

4 - 7.1 -> 'while' loop and incrementing

\*while True loop
-while True: is known as the forever loop because it loops forever
-the while True: loop can be interrupted using the break statement, which causes the code flow to exit the loop
-a conditional can also implement break to exit a while True loop
-Example:
while True:
    print('write forever, unless there is a "break"')
    break
-Example containing a condition:
number\_guess = "0"
secret\_number = "5"
while True:
    number\_guess = input("guess the number 1 to 5: ")
    if number\_guess == secret\_number:
        print("Yes", number\_guess,"is correct!\\n")
        break
    else:
        print(number\_guess,"is incorrect\\n")

\*increment a variable
-Increment: votes = votes + 1     or   votes += 1
-Decrement: votes = votes - 1     or   votes -= 1 
-Example:
seat\_count = 0
while True:
    print("seat count:",seat\_count)
    seat\_count = seat\_count + 1

    if seat\_count > 4:
        break

4 - 7.2 -> 'while' Boolean loops

\*while with Boolean comparison
-With increment we used break when count becomes greater than some number.
-However, the same result can be achieved by using while x < 5:
-Example:
greet\_count = 5
# loop while count is greater than 0
while greet\_count > 0:
    print(greet\_count, "!")
    greet\_count -= 1
print("\\nIGNITION!")

\*while with Boolean string tests
-A while loop can be controlled by Boolean strings such as while name.isalpha() == False:
-Example:
# review and run example that loops until a valid first name format is entered
student\_fname = ""
while student\_fname.isalpha() == False:
    student\_fname = input("enter student\\'s first (Letters only, No spaces): ")
print("\\n" + student\_fname.title(),"has been entered as first name")

\*continue 
-The continue statement ends the current iteration and jumps to the top of the loop to start the next iteration

while True:
    line = input('> ')
    if line\[0\] == '#' :
        continue
    if line == 'done' :
        break
    print(line)

print('Done!')

4 - 7.3 -> for loops

-a definite, finite loop

for i in \[5,4,3,2,1]\ : (can use integers, strings...)
    print(i)
----------------   
smallest = None
for value in \[4,2,1\]:
   if smallest is None: ('is not' also exists, usually used for True/False/None, stronger than ==)
       smallest = value
   elif value < smallest:
       smallest = value
