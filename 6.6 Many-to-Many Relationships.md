## Many-to-Many Relationships

- the relationships covered so far are one-to-many (one album has many tracks)

![[db-one-to-many.png]]

- sometimes we need to model a many-to-many relationship;
- we need to add a ==connection table== with ==two foreign keys==; there is usually ==no separate primary key==

- the many-to-many relationship gets decomposed into many-to-one relationships

- start with a fresh database

```
CREATE TABLE User (
	id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
	name TEXT,
	email TEXT
)

CREATE TABLE Course (
	id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
	title TEXT
)

CREATE TABLE Member (
	user_id INTEGER,
	course_id INTEGER,
	role INTEGER,
	PRIMARY KEY (user_id, course_id)
)
```

- insert users and courses

```
INSERT INTO User (name, email) VALUES ('Jane', 'jane@tsugi.org');
INSERT INTO User (name, email) VALUES ('Ed', 'ed@tsugi.org');
INSERT INTO User (name, email) VALUES ('Sue', 'sue@tsugi.org');

INSERT INTO Course (title) VALUES ('Python');
INSERT INTO Course (title) VALUES ('SQL');
INSERT INTO Course (title) VALUES ('PHP');
```

- insert memberships (role: 1 for instructors, 0 for students)

```
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (1, 1, 1);
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (2, 1, 0);
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (3, 1, 0);

INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (1, 2, 0);
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (2, 2, 1);

INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (2, 3, 1);
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (3, 3, 0);
```

- write the select statement

```
SELECT User.name, Member.role, Course.title
FROM User JOIN Member JOIN Course
ON Member.user_id = User.id AND Member.course_id = Course.id
ORDER BY Course.title, Member.role DESC, User.name
```
